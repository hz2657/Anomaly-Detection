# Summary 

Apply the SHAP Values to mortgage probability of default modeling data set (with variables/features).  
 
**SHAP Values**
1. help clients to understand why the observation is predicted in that result, it measures the contribution of a variable, calculate contribution towards target.
2. can show positive/negative relationship in variable importance plot for random forest
3. can show image for individual observation for reasons of prediction 
 
**Benefit**
 1. global interpretability: show how much each variable contribute, house analogy
 2. local interpretability: each observation get its own set of SHAP values
