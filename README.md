**background**
Banks loan out money to earn interest as revenue, however, some borrowers may not be able to repay the loan. The probability of loan default is 5%. 

In this case, banks apply machine learning models to predict probability of default (PD), high prediction value means the person is more likely to default, vice versa. 

By ranking applicants' risk from high to low, grouping candidates from high-low risk groups, a good ML model can distinguish these candidate groups. The process is called the Gains Table. 

**How Gains Table works**
The banks rank applicants by predicted probability of default (PD) from high to low and group them into 10 differnet buskets, called decile. It contains the predicted PD, and the actual number of default for each decile. 

Assume the PD for the population is 10%, we take into account the case without grouping applicants by predicted PD. 

2 measurements
- lift: which is also called cummulative lift, measures how likely the company will get the bad loans, if compared with the random results

- Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S): measures the degree of separation between the distributions of the good loans and the bad loands
