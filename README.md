Anomaly detection helps in the early detection of critical outliers in a system. Based on the context, these outliers can be detrimental and result in loss of resources, and time through errors, fraud, manipulation of stocks, and other such malicious activities. Outliers can also be beneficial in investing, and arbitrage. Business decisions that leverage anomaly detection, which used to require intense human resource and capacity can now be completed in a short time through versatile models and automation.

**project goal**
