# Identify outliers in the credit card dataset by unsupervised learning

**project structure**


**key steps**

1. construct features

2. build model

3. select threshold

4. show summary statistics + implementation



**Section 1 PCA**


**Section 2 Unsupervised KNN**

1. method description:  KNN has both supervised and unsupervised algorithm, distance is to the neighbors. K Nearest Neighbour is a simple algorithm that stores all the available cases and classifies the new data or case based on a similarity measure. It is mostly used to classifies a data point based on how its neighbours are classified.

2. test hyper-parameters

3. summary statistics for the variables by cluster, identify outliers & business insight
